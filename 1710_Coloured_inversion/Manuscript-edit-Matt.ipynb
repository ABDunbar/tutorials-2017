    "Whether it is deterministic, band-limited or stochastic, seismic inversion can bear many names depending on the algorithm used to produce it. Broadly, inversion converts reflectivity data to physical properties of the earth, such as acoustic impedance, the product of seismic velocity and bulk density. This is useful because, while reflectivity informs us about boundaries, impedance can be converted to useful earth propertes such as porosity and fluid content via known petrophysical relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lancaster and Whitcombe (2000) published a fast method for band-limited inversion of seismic data known as colored inversion (CI) that generated widespread interest among interpreters. Recognizing that the popular sparse-spike inversion process could be approximated by a single operator, yielding relative impedance via simple convolution with the reflectivity data, the authors showed that this operator can be derived from well logs. Like other inversions, CI can help remove the smearing effects of the seismic wavelet and enhance features such as thin beds and discontinuities. What's more, since CI is directly linked to seismic data, the relative impedance it produces can be used as a base for comparison with other inversion to see what kind of information is introduced by numerical constraints or the low-frequency model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we follow the steps presented by Lancaster and Whitcombe in their 2000 expanded abstract to achieve the so-called \"fast-track colored inversion\". Using open-source algorithms, we describe all the steps to go from reflectivity data to inverted cubes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tFit a function to the log spectrum(s).\n",
    "2.\tGet a difference spectrum by substracting the seismic spectrum.\n",
    "3.\tConvert the difference spectrum to an operator.\n",
    "4.\tConvolve the operator with the stacked seismic.\n",
    "5.\tAs a QC step, check the residuals by comparing log and AI section spectrums.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of this tutorial is to achieve a colored inversion without any external software, just Python code with the NumPy and SciPy libraries. You can read and run the code for yourself from the repository at **github.com/seg/tutorials-2017**. The tutorial focus on presenting the whole workflow in the simplest fashion rather than trying to optimize parameters to recover interpretable features. Prior to running the workflow on your data, noise attenuation should be performed to ensure that the inversion process recovers frequencies associated only with the Earth."

Good descriptions of the geological setting of this dataset can be found in Sorensen et al. (1997) and Overeem et al. (2001).

    "We would like to simplify the spectrum, so we proceed to a regression. To make the process more robust, CI packages offer you the option of averaging this spectrum over all the available wells, but we can skip tht as we are working with only a single well. In order to proceed to a linear regression, we define two simple functions, one that serves as the linearization of the problem and one for the error function.

It is important to note that our end result will be greatly influenced by this choice and care should be applied at this stage."

    "\n",
    "We have presented a straightforward application of colored inversion using only Python with the NumPy and SciPy libraries. This open-source workflow is documented at **github.com/seg**; it is simple and fast, and yields informative images to interpreters. It is called a 'robust' process in the literature, but it is somewhat sensitive to the chosen frequency range. There are also choices to be made about the window of application and the number of traces for spectra calculation. An important thing to understand about inversion such as CI is that it cannot be informative of trends."
